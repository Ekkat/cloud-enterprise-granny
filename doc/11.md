## One for All

Once you've worked in this fast-paced industry for a while you understand that technologies come and go. The longer you are in the business the more familiar are the patterns of the hype cycle accompanying the latest trends. That's when you are slowly getting fed up of terms like *game changing*, *disruptive*, *innovative* and so on... that's when you start to automatically take it with a grain of salt when you hear someone talk about **_'best practices'_**.

I have to confess that I'm guilty of using the term myself in the context of presenting proven software architecture and design patterns to my fellow peers.
