### The Background Story

Those who closely follow this space may remember the blog posts about
"Granny's Addressbook", a sample application created by a company called [Open
Software Integrators](http://www.osintegrators.com/about) for the purpose of
teaching how-to develop Spring-based Java applications. This sample
applications was used as a reference to compare several PaaS offerings in the
market - see [Which freaking PaaS should I use?](http://www.infoworld.com/d/cloud-computing/which-freaking-paas-should-i-use-204189)

Unfortunately the SAP HANA Cloud Platform wasn't on their radar back then, but
once we heard about their comparison and the demo app we took our chances and
deployed the app to our cloud platform. It run right away, w/o any
modifications required. [Harald Muller](https://scn.sap.com/people/harald.mueller), Chief Product
Owner of the JVM-based Runtime capabilities of the SAP HANA Cloud Platform,
shared his experiences in a blog post: [Which freaking PaaS should I use
(1/2)?](http://scn.sap.com/community/developer-center/cloud-platform/blog/2012/10/10/which-freaking-paas-should-i-use-12)

Yet, he did not stop there and instead tinkered with it a bit more to "_make
the app a bit more enterprise ready!_"

Andrew Oliver (the original author) noticed our efforts via Twitter and
responded with a dedicated blog post titled "[The best-run Granny's
addressbooks run on SAP](http://osintegrators.com/SAPknowsGranny)". This is
how the idea of "Enterprise Granny" was born...

### Enterprise Granny

The idea is simple: let's take this simple sample application and make it
enterprise-ready. It's Maven-based and uses the popular Spring framework - a
very common archetype out there - and as such seems like the perfect fit to
showcase how-to port an existing Java application and optimize it for the SAP
HANA Cloud Platform. We'll take it easy at first and apply a few subtle
changes touching upon the most common development tasks like implementing
logging/tracing, exception handling, I18N and so on. Later on, we may want to
enhance the application to demonstrate how-to best leverage the capabilities
of the SAP HANA Cloud Platform. In short: **we'll have plenty of fun with it!**

**Note:** I'm fully aware that the original intent of the application was purely for training purposes and that some of application's shortcomings are on purpose for educational reasons. Matter of fact, I'm considering to make a few common mistakes myself along the way in order to correct them at a later point in time for the exact same reason! As such, please do not mistake me talking about shortcomings in the original app as criticizing OS Integrators or their develovers!

### There's no spoon - but a fork!

As you hopefully know we have started to publish a variety of open-source
samples on our github page: [sap.github.io](http://sap.github.io/) or
([github.com/SAP](https://github.com/SAP/) respectively). Consequently I did
[fork](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_(software_development)) the original
repo (repository) in order to create a new branch for Enterprise Granny.

You can find it here: [https://github.com/SAP/cloud-enterprise-
granny](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-enterprise-granny)

Those of you who are interested to follow-up on this journey are more than
welcome - and don't worry: we'll take it easy and enhance the app step-by-
step! After all, the whole purpose of this exercise is to provide you with
some guidance on how-to develop great cloud applications based on Open Source.


### _Happy coding everyone!!!_

PS: Of course we all know that there's only one person who can legitimately
call herself "Enterprise Granny", which is the one-and-only [Marilyn
Pratt](http://scn.sap.com/people/marilyn.pratt) (aka **Grannimari**). In more than one way this can be
considered a [hommage](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hommage) to her and her
ways of sharing with the community and hence I hope she doesn't mind us (re-)
using that title ! ;)
