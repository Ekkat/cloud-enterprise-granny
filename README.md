SAP HANA Cloud Platform Samples - enterprise granny
========

This sample is a fork of the original [Granny's Addressbook] (https://github.com/osintegrators/JavaSpringGranny) provided by Open Software Integrators. 

It's currently a work in progress - stay tuned!

Quick start
-----------

Clone the repo, `git clone https://github.com/SAP/cloud-enterprise-granny.git`, or [download the latest release](https://github.com/SAP/cloud-enterprise-granny/archive/master.zip).


Versioning
----------

For transparency and insight into our release cycle, and for striving to maintain backward compatibility, the SAP HANA Cloud Platform- Samples project will be maintained under the Semantic Versioning guidelines as much as possible.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major (and resets the minor and patch)
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor (and resets the patch)
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch
